## Profession
<font size ="4">
This place is used to share Ruiyuan(Ralph) Kang's ideas and life, yeah, it's me. <br />
I'm temporally a PhD candidate in Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE;  
a member of KU-Alibaba intelligent Energy Lab.<br />   
My research interest mainly focuses on Machine learning on flame/gas diagnostics.<br />  
Meanwhile, I'm also a crazy fan of Aerospace, I have ever been educated and done some research in this field systematically for 8 years.<br /> </font>
## Self life
<font size ="4">As a normal boy, I pretty like to play basketball. <br /> However, since the "lovely" weather in Abu, I have to turn to gym and play weights most of time.</font>

## Where you can find me
<font size ="4"> I think the website is full of my footprints  </font>
